# Google Fonts Previewer
A simple tool to preview your content with +1500 Google Fonts, built with `HTML/CSS/JavaScript`!

## How to use it?
- Go to the [Live Previewer](https://elharony.github.io/Google-Fonts-Previewer/)
- Write whatever you want in the not-so grey area
- Click on any font from the left-side menu, it has +1500 fonts available
- Increase/Decrease the `font-size` with a slider

## Why I should use it, instead of `Google Fonts`?
- `Google Fonts` layout isn't really good, you have to keep scrolling to find a suitable font
- Instead of testing your text for each single font, here's the opposite; Write the text ones, and keep clicking on different fonts to see how it looks!
